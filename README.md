On the Lecture # 2 I've learned a lot about branching:
 - how to check available in repository branches
 - how to add/rename/delete branches
 - how merge changes to branch in different ways (fast-forward, recursive)
 - how to merge conflicts and create pull requests.
 - README
 - adding tags
 - git ignore and other interesting and tricky moments in Git.
